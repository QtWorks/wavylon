   Many new bugs are presented to you with the new major release!
   But new features are worth that.
   Now EKO is able to open MP3 and videofiles (as audio) using external command line tools FFMPEG or Mplayer. MP3 export via LAME. FXRack has been modified to the Mixer. Undo engine has been improved. A lot of internals has been rewritten, including the selection and looping code.
   Stay tuned.
